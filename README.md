# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
#### Through this project, I have analyzed data from kickstarter campaigns from 2009 through 2017. Many different parameters and indicators were used in this analysis such as countries of origin, categories and subcategories, fundraising goals, launch dates, length of campaigns, etc. Through this analysis I have created relationships between data points to determine ideal conditions to execute a successful campaign. 

#### Our client, Louise, is looking to execute and fund a new venture also known as a "kickstarter" campaign. Specifically, she is interested in creating a new theater play, Fever. Through this analysis of data surrounding kickstarter campaign outcomes, we are helping Louise determine which range of parameters would indicate success for her play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### One of the parameters I explored, was the relation of outcomes and the dates in which campaigns were launched. This was a particular area of interest so that I could determine which time of year (i.e., month) would be more ideal in generating a successful campaign. Through this specific analysis, it was determined that historically, May could be an ideal month to start a new campaign, as the most successful theater launches occured in this month. I also determined that the least beneficial month would be December. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### The next area of interest was the comparison of outcomes of campaigns to their goal fundraising amount. Through this analysis I focused on examining the relationship between fundraising goals set (organized in tier form) and the amount of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. Drawing this relationships helps to determine what level of a fundraising goal would be ideal for creating a successful campaign. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Some challenges were faced in this analysis. Specifically, there were outliers in the data that may skew how we determine what level is ideal for success.

## Results

### Conclusions

#### The best month to start a new theater campaign is May. 
#### The worst month to start a new theater campaign is December. 
#### The ideal fundraising goal should be under 5000, as this is the fundraising amount where the most percentage of campaigns succeed. 

#### Some limitations to this dataset are accounting for major events in the world. Outcomes of campaigns could be affected based on financial crises, world events, and general interest from the public, that may not correlate to either of these parameters directly. Countries in which these campaigns can also greatly impact the results, as there are inherent cultures and preferences based on those cultures that can affect how well a campaign performs. Some additional graphs, or relations can be drawn between country of origin and success of a campaign, or in this case a play.
